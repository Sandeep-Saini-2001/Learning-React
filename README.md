# Learning React

# parcel
- Dev build
- local server
- HMR = Hot Module Replacement
- parcel uses the File Watching Algorithm - written in c++   
- caching - faster builds
- Image Optimization
- Minification
- Bundling
- Compress
- consistent Hashing
- code spliting
- Differential Bundling - support older browsers
- Diagnostic - Error handling (also gives suggestion)
- parcel can also host our app in HTTPs
- Tree shaking - remove unused code
- Parcel creates a different build for dev and prod (prod builds are taking more time because it requires more optimization)
